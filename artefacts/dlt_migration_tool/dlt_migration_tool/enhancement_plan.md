# Databricks Pipeline Migration Tool Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines planned enhancements for the Databricks Pipeline Migration Tool, which converts legacy pipeline configurations to the new Delta Live Tables (DLT) Framework format.

## Current Status
The tool currently:
- Converts legacy DLT-meta configurations to DLT Framework dataflowspec format
- Generates both bronze and silver configurations from a single input file
- Detects Maximo patterns automatically
- Uses proper file naming conventions with "_main" suffix
- Handles schema paths with "maximo_" prefix
- Ensures consistent view name format "v_{table_name}"
- Organizes output files into appropriate directories
- Provides schema management functionality

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Improved Schema Handling
- **Schema Validation**: Add validation of generated schemas against actual table structures
- **Schema Merging**: Implement intelligent merging of schema changes when updating
- **Schema Versioning**: Add support for schema versioning and change tracking
- **Schema Documentation**: Generate documentation from schema definitions

### 2. Configuration Validation
- **Pre-validation**: Validate input configurations before processing
- **Post-validation**: Validate output configurations against DLT Framework requirements
- **Reference Validation**: Ensure all references between configurations are valid
- **Dependency Tracking**: Track dependencies between configurations

### 3. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Expand test coverage for all components
- **Integration Tests**: Add tests for end-to-end workflow
- **Validation Tests**: Add tests to verify output against reference configurations
- **Performance Tests**: Measure and optimize performance for large sets of configurations

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- **Interactive Mode**: Add interactive mode for CLI with guided configuration
- **Progress Reporting**: Improve progress reporting for long-running operations
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages with suggestions for resolution
- **Configuration Templates**: Provide templates for common configuration patterns

### 5. Databricks Integration
- **Workspace Integration**: Deeper integration with Databricks workspace
- **Job Scheduling**: Support for scheduling migration jobs
- **Automated Deployment**: Automated deployment of migrated configurations
- **Rollback Support**: Support for rolling back to previous configurations

### 6. Documentation and Examples
- **User Guide**: Comprehensive user guide with examples
- **API Documentation**: Complete API documentation for programmatic use
- **Migration Patterns**: Document common migration patterns and best practices
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Guide for troubleshooting common issues

### 7. Advanced Features
- **Batch Processing**: Support for batch processing of large numbers of configurations
- **Custom Mappings**: Support for custom mapping rules
- **Configuration Diff**: Visual diff between original and migrated configurations
- **Migration Reports**: Generate detailed reports on migration results

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Current): Core functionality for migration and schema management
- **Phase 2** (Next): Improved validation, testing, and user experience
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features and deeper Databricks integration
- **Phase 4**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Conclusion
These enhancements will make the Databricks Pipeline Migration Tool more robust, user-friendly, and integrated with the Databricks ecosystem, ensuring a smooth migration path for users transitioning to the new DLT Framework.
